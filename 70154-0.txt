If Maudie had only given me the ten thousand dollars to invest in
the Martian Development Company there would have been no reason
to kill her. The money would have been more than tripled and my
financial troubles would have been over. But Maudie has always been so
unreasonable. Even though she grudgingly admitted that I had been right
in the Martian venture, she still had no faith in my business judgment.
She was as adamant as ever about parting with the smallest fraction of
her vast fortune when I had the opportunity to step in on the ground
floor of the Balsavius Six Mining Corporation.

Balsavius Six, in case you don't know, is the newest planet which
Earth's space ships have touched. Everything about Balsavius has
been kept strictly hush-hush. Only a handful of people have the
slightest concept of the value of the new planet's mineral deposits.
It just happened that one of the men in on the top secret was my
friend Sylvester, and he was willing to cut me in on a slice of the
corporation he was forming for as little as five thousand dollars on
the line.

The problem was how to get my hands on that much folding stuff. The
answer should have been easy. Maudie (Mrs. Maude Terrain) was one of
Earth's wealthiest women and, after all, Maudie was my mother-in-law.
The trouble with Maudie was that she was narrow-minded, prejudiced, I
might say bigoted. She liked to boast that her family have come from
good, solid Earth stock from the beginning of time and, while she
mingled with the socially elite from Venus, she considered Martians
crude, and refused to entertain guests from what she described as "the
minor planets."

Maudie's second trouble was that she was mean. Although her daughter,
Isabelle, and I have been married for eight years, Maudie never did
more than to provide us with a modest allowance. She always felt that I
should work which, after all, is pretty non-sensical when there are so
many ways for a man with a little capital to get rich quick.

Isabelle isn't like Maudie. She's easy-going, pliant, susceptible
to flattery and, on Maudie's death, Isabelle would inherit her full
fortune. So with a deal like this in the offing, it didn't take any
great brain to see that Maudie's rapid demise would remove the single
obstacle that stood between myself and untold wealth.

The thought of killing Maudie had come often to my mind since my talk
with Sylvester but the available weapons all seemed too crude. I'm a
fastidious person and the idea of shooting or stabbing Maudie was just
too vulgar. One of the more subtle poisons might have turned the trick,
but certainly nothing as obvious as cyanide or arsenic. As for curare
or beleston, to be frank, I hadn't the foggiest notion where to lay my
hands on them.

That's the way things stood when I just happened to stop in front of
the window of Melvin Rosy's House of Fantastic Jewelry in Greenwich
Village. I'd passed by the shop many times but I'd never paused to
look in. Of recent years, the Village has filled up with all sorts of
peculiar people, Martians, Venusians and the little green men from
outer space. One thing I'll have to hand to Maudie, she was right about
calling some of these people uncouth. Some of the Galaxians really are
riff-raff.

Out in front of the store were some long pink fliers advertising the
jewelry within. I picked one up idly, for it had just occurred to me
that Maudie's birthday was the next day and that it might not be a bad
idea to soften her up with a gift. I looked at the monstrous chunks of
jewelry in the display window--rings, bracelets and whatnots, decorated
with staring eyes, floating amoebas and gilded kidneys. Maudie was a
pushover for spectacular accoutrements but this stuff exceeded even her
flamboyant taste.

Probably I would have walked on by if a couple of lines at the top of
the flier hadn't caught my attention. They were written by some old
time humorist called S. J. Perelman and he described the jewelry as
being like, "an egg balanced on a cone, an erg balanced on a bone, a
hag balanced on a roan."

That last part seemed a perfect description of Maudie--"a hag balanced
on a roan." Almost by instinct I started to climb the crooked stone
steps to the shop. The door was open and the proprietor was standing
behind the counter. Other than that the place was empty.

I'd seen Melvin Rosy around before. He was a big brute of a man with a
shaggy red beard who sported a dangling jade earring in his left ear.
I'd always suspected that Rosy had Martian blood but I'd never been
sure until I glimpsed the little purple flecks in the lines of his
palms that are a dead giveaway.

Rosy looked up and his gaze seemed to go right through me. Some of
these Martian chaps have an uncanny skill at reading your mind. Rosy's
voice was clear and soft but it had the timbre of some stringed
instrument. He said, "A gift perhaps. For a woman?"

I nodded but I almost jumped out of my skin when he added, "For your
mother-in-law, I should imagine. I'm sure I have just the thing."

He showed me a half dozen pendants and bracelets but I could see his
heart wasn't in it. He was sizing me up, wanting to make sure of
me before he offered the _piece de resistance_. I could feel
excitement surging up inside of me, even though I had no notion of what
he would bring forth.

Finally he went to the rear of the shop and disappeared behind a batik
curtain. When he returned he held in his hand a heart-shaped box of
deep-napped velvet, royal purple in color. He laid the box on the glass
counter but his wide palm nearly covered it.

His eyes held mine and his thick lips quirked in a smile that was
almost a grimace. He said, "I take it you want an extra-special gift. I
might say a gift for the departing, even a fatal gift."

I gulped and nodded.

He raised the box and slipped the catch. The lid rose slowly on coiled
hinges and I was staring at the most delicately wrought necklace I had
ever seen. It was long and thin, no wider than a shoestring, and the
clasp was a beautifully constructed replica of a snake's head. I looked
at the intricate design of the narrow chain with wonder. Certainly it
was not a product of Earth, I thought. Nowhere on this planet do we
have craftsmen capable of such elaboration of minutiae.

Even more striking than the workmanship of the chain was its
coloration. It was not gold, as I had first thought, but a metal
unknown to me with a flame-like orange glow. My gaze was drawn away
from the necklace by Rosy's soft chuckle.

"It is magnificent, is it not?"

"Yes," I said, "but far beyond my means. I had in mind some trifle--"

Rosy lifted a hand for silence and again I noticed the purple flecks in
the palm. He said, "Nothing is too expensive for the woman you hate."

I began to stutter a protest but something in Rosy's expression stopped
me. He spoke gently, as though humoring a child. "We do not need to
discuss price. The necklace will make you a wealthy man. We can settle
upon terms then."

"I don't understand."

"Ah, but you will," he said smiling. "You do not recognize the metal.
There is nothing strange about that. Probably no man of Earth has ever
seen it and lived. In Mars it has been given the name of Malutrex
and, even there, it is both rare and extremely expensive because of
its peculiar properties. In all, I doubt if more than a dozen such
necklaces were made up. They are called,"--he stopped to underscore his
point, "Murderer's Chains."

I think he expected me to ask why. But for some reason my throat was
so dry that I couldn't trust myself to speak.

"You will recall," he continued slowly, "that way back in the twentieth
century when the Martians first came to Earth, they were not made
exactly welcome. Our first space ships were fired upon and many of
our people were killed. Our next step was secret infiltration. We
landed our ships in deserts and other isolated spots and unloaded
select groups to intermingle with the Earth people and, because we
are a superior race, soon many of our representatives held important
posts among the governments of the Earth, especially that of the
United States. To these Martians fell the task of breaking down
ancient prejudices so that Earth could be opened to unrestricted trade
and immigration. This was not easy. The men of Earth still remained
hostile to us and, when we were unmasked as Martians, many of us were
imprisoned and some were beaten to death, even executed. The people of
Earth were, as a whole, complacent but they were whipped up to a frenzy
by scare-mongers and demagogues whose voices it became necessary to
silence.

"Open retaliation would have done more harm than good and it was then
that the Martians found the perfect weapon--Malutrex. This is a metal
quite harmless to Martians for, as you know, our blood has a quite
different composition than yours. We can handle Malutrex without the
slightest danger. Look--" He reached down, coiled the slender chain
about his wrist, caught the hook in the tongue-like catch of the
delicate clasp then unloosened it again.

He smiled and was silent for a minute, studying my face. When he spoke
again it was with slow deliberation. "Maybe, you remember hearing tales
long ago of 'the silent death'. Certain isolationist Congressmen and
Senators who spear-headed the opposition to interplanetary development
died mysteriously and without visible cause. Malutrex was the cause of
their deaths."

I was culling out half-forgotten bits of information that I had learned
as a schoolboy. "But how--"

Again the purple-flecked palm raised to interrupt me. "Earth men
are hot-blooded. The chemical analysis of their bodies--but I won't
bother you with the technicalities. In plain language, once a chain
of Malutrex circles human flesh, it begins to shrink, slowly, almost
invisibly. It grows tighter and tighter until it becomes a strangler's
noose. And there is nothing, absolutely nothing, that the Earth man can
do about it. Once the clasp is fastened, no matter how he tries, he
cannot undo it nor, after a few minutes, can he loosen the chain from
his skin. In most cases the victim is taken completely unaware by the
death creeping upon him. Malutrex constricts gradually and painlessly
except for the last spluttering moment of life."

My knees felt a little weak and my stomach queezy. "Why tell me? Why
should you let me in on this secret?"

Rosy's smile became more intimate. "Mrs. Terrain is not exactly
popular among Martians," he said softly. "If I remember correctly,
she is the Chairman of the League to Oppose Interplanetary Marriage,
and has financed the Earth Citizens Council to name only a few of the
discriminatory organizations with which she has linked herself. Perhaps
you, as her heir, could put her fortune to a better use."

"There's no doubt of that," I said.

"Well, then--"

"But I've no desire to be dissolved in the death ray chamber for
murder."

"Nor is there any need to do so. Look, was a single one of our
assassins caught?"

"But the necklace would be found embedded in her flesh."

He shook his head. "Perhaps I've not made the situation clear. The
pumping of the heart, the warmth of the blood cause Malutrex to
contract. As soon as death sets in the necklace resumes its normal
proportions. The clasp can be unfastened, the necklace removed, and as
long as the ends do not meet it remains completely harmless."

I gulped again. Murder in the abstract is one thing; planned,
cold-blooded murder is something else again. But Maudie dead, and all
that money in my hands! Suddenly I laughed as I saw where my thoughts
were leading me. The whole thing was a hoax of some kind.

As before, Rosy seemed to read my mind. He reached for my wrist
and twisted the necklace about it. I stared at the delicate chain
in fascination. As I watched, I could see the metal shrink, barely
perceptibly, but certainly for all that. I clawed at the clasp and
tried to unfasten it. It was utterly hopeless and swift panic swept
over me. I grasped the slender chain and tried to wrench it free. It
was tougher than finely tempered steel. Sweat popped out on my forehead
and I could hardly repress a scream.

With a knowing nod of his head, Rosy leaned forward and lifted my
wrist. He opened the catch with a lazy flick of his fingers. I was
breathing hard and scared half out of my wits but I was caught in the
trap that Rosy had set for me. Maudie dead, myself a millionaire, and
no chance of being caught. This was too good to pass up. I knew it and
so did Rosy. All we had to do was agree on terms. Half an hour later
when I left the House of Fantastic Jewelry, the royal purple box with
the Murderer's Chain lay in my pocket, beautifully gift-wrapped.

I had to lay my plans carefully but unwittingly Maudie and Isabelle
conspired to make it easy. A dinner had been arranged at Maudie's
apartment as a birthday celebration. The only other guests would be
Sylvester and his wife. Maudie had been complaining of bad headaches
of late and never liked to go out after dinner, but she had purchased
four tickets for the most popular play of the season, "The Fairest of
Ladies", and insisted that the four of us should see it. She would rest
while we were gone but would keep her light on so that Isabelle could
come in to kiss her good-night.

Everything went like clockwork. I bought a little gift for Maudie and
presented it to her early in the evening. The dinner was very gay and,
just as we were about to leave, I announced that I had another gift.
Maudie was delighted with the chain. I didn't even have to fasten it
around her neck as I had planned. She snapped the clasp herself and
went to the mirror in the foyer, preening and admiring herself and the
necklace that winked and glittered in the light. I was the last one out
of the door and Maudie clung to me for a minute, drawing my head down
to kiss me. Maybe she'd softened up enough to lend me a few thousand,
I thought, but even if she had, it was too late. I couldn't very well
snatch the necklace back even if it were possible to release it from
about her throat.

I don't remember much about the play. I was thinking of Maudie all
the time and I was torn between all sorts of doubts and fears. One
minute I'd be way down in the dumps and the next I'd be floating up in
the clouds planning all the good times Isabelle and I could have with
Maudie's millions. In my mind I'd see a picture of Maudie lying dead
and then I'd decide that Rosy had conned me and Maudie would be as spry
as ever when we got home. Sometimes I'd want it one way and sometimes
the other. I was really mixed up and on edge.

The play seemed to last for about ten light years but actually it
wasn't quite midnight when we caught a taxi outside the theatre. As
soon as we rounded the corner and were in sight of the marquee of the
apartment house, I knew something had gone wrong. Two red and white
police cars blocked off the entrance of the house and a curious throng
of people had gathered around.

I'd expected to have a chance to retrieve the necklace before the
police were called. In the confusion of discovering her body no one
would notice or, even if some one did, it wouldn't appear particularly
odd for me to unfasten the necklace and slip it in my pocket. After
all, it would have been my last gift to her.

With the police already on the scene that part of the plan was out.
Nothing was left except to play it by ear. We pushed our way through
the curious idlers and the neighbors who'd come out into the halls. A
cop was at the front door but as soon as we'd identified ourselves he
ushered us into Maudie's big front room. Only two cops were there. I
didn't get the smaller one's name but the towering man in plain clothes
introduced himself as Lieutenant Onsett, of Central Homicide.

Just the mention of homicide was enough to give me the jitters bad
but fortunately Isabelle stole the scene with a fit of hysterics that
nearly blew the roof of the place. She distracted everyone with her
screaming jag long enough for me to slip into the bedroom for a look
at Maudie. She lay straight on the bed, her arms flung out, her face
contorted and blue but not a mark on her throat.

What I wanted most was to get my hands on the necklace but when I drew
close to her I could see that it was gone. I stood still, breathing
hard, trying to collect my wits. Could the necklace have slipped off
after death? I scanned the bed-clothes, the carpet beside the bed, the
medicine table. No sign of it.

I hadn't heard anyone enter the room but when I looked up, I found
myself staring into the pale gray eyes of Lieutenant Onsett. His face
wore an official mask of blankness but it was belied by the quirk of
his lips. He knew something, I thought, or at least he was suspicious.
I had to take a firm grip on myself not to make a break for it and try
to rush past him to the freedom of the hall.

Onsett motioned me back to the front room. Isabelle had quieted down
although she was still sobbing. Sylvester and his wife were sitting on
the divan holding hands and looking distraught. I went to Isabelle and
slid my arms around her and waited to see what would come next.

The questioning was all very polite, in perfect order. The details of
the birthday dinner and the theatre party came out. We learned, in
turn, that a friend of Maudie's who had a key to the apartment had
dropped in to surprise her with a birthday gift and had discovered the
body. There was some mention of the necklace but neither Onsett nor his
partner pursued the matter. I was beginning to feel cocky again, sure
that Maudie's death would be put down to accidental strangulation or a
heart attack.

In about an hour we were all told that we could leave but just as we
got to the door, Onsett called me back and asked me to wait. Sylvester
offered to take Isabelle home and I didn't dare to protest too much.
I stood in the middle of the room, listening to their footsteps die
away in the hall and then I turned to face Onsett. His partner had
disappeared and the two of us were alone in the room.

He sat down in an easy chair and crossed his legs. There wasn't
anything for me to do but try to appear as much at ease as he. We sat
there in silence for long minutes. Finally Onsett dug out a cigarette
and offered me one. I took it and lit up. The smoke burned my throat
but having something to do with my hands helped.

I was scared but I reckoned that the best thing to do was put on a show
of indignation. "What is this?" I blustered. "I've told you everything
I know."

He gave a thin smile. "I don't think so, Mr. Duff."

"I don't care what you think, I've nothing more to say."

He snuffed out his cigarette very carefully in one of Maudie's little
mosaic ashtrays and slowly his hand dipped into his pocket. When it
came out, the necklace dangled from his fingers.

I could feel my heart lurch but I still tried to bluff it out,
complaining about being separated from Isabelle. Onsett didn't say a
word, just dangled the chain so that the light from the lamp rippled
along its slender surface.

In a few minutes I ran out of words. Onsett gave a deep sigh and rose
from his chair.

"Do you want to tell me about this little gift to your mother-in-law?"

I clamped my lips shut. "I'm through. Finished. I'll not say another
word."

The quirk of his lips reminded me of Melvin Rosy. He raised the chain
over my head and the next thing I knew it was about my throat. My
fingers scrabbled for it but I couldn't pry it loose. I gave up and
stared at Onsett in stunned silence. His hands were still outstretched
and as I looked up at them, I could see the tiny purple flecks in his
palms. I couldn't believe it. Not at first. Whoever heard of a Martian
making the New York Police force? But when he spoke, his voice had
dropped its growl. It was soft and musical, a Martian voice.

He said, "I think you're going to tell me everything I want to know.
You'll write it all down too."

Like I said before, it's really uncanny the way some of these Martian
chaps can read your mind. He was right, straight down the line. I told
him everything. I wrote it all down and didn't waste any time about it
because every second the necklace was growing smaller and smaller.

When I finished, I signed it and pushed it over to him.

Here it is.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
